This page describes setup that should preferably be done before you arrive at the course to help make the best use of your class time. The course exercises will be done on **your personal laptop** to better allow you to continue using what you learn in the course after you leave.

## Getting a Compute Canada Cloud account

There are two steps to getting a CC Cloud account

1. Get a general Compute Canada account
2. Get a Compute Canada Cloud account

To get a Compute Canada account you need to either be a faculty member or librarian at a recognized academic institution in Canada or be know someone who is that can sponsor your Compute Canada account. To get a Compute Canada account follow the instructions provided on this [Compute Canada page](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account/).

Once you have a CC account, you then apply for a cloud account [here](https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/national-services/compute-canada-cloud/create-a-cloud-account/). You will need to provide your CC account user name and an email associated with your CC account.

## Ensure you can open a terminal

We will be using the terminal to connect to our virtual machines we create in the cloud. For windows users [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is recommended. For Linux and mac users you already have a terminal built in. To see how to open your terminal on your Mac see this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zw7Nd67_aFw). Because there are so many types of Linux it would be too tedious to list all the different ways to access a terminal in Linux, however if you are using Linux there is a fairly good chance you already know how to access your terminal, if not we will help you find it at the beginning of the course.
