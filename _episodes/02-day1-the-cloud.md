In the previous episode we looked at how the Internet works at a very basic level. To visit a website you enter an domain name into your browser which is converted to an IP address which directs you at a computer (or LAN which then routes you to a specific computer based on the type of traffic) which then provides you with a website. Anyone connected to the Internet can potentially put up a website for the world to see. This ability for anyone to do this is part of what makes the Internet so great, in that you don't need lots of money and infrastructure to do this, just a computer and an Internet connection and some time to burn setting it up. However, what happens as your website grows in popularity? You get many more computers requesting your content, at some point this becomes too much for a single computer to handle so, you have to go out and get more computers. This adds not only the cost of the computers but also the time to set them up. In addition, that high load you just got, well it was a passing phase, and no one wants to visit your site any more and you have 10 computers you paid for not being used anymore.

Cloud to the rescue.
